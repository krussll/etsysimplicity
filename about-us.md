We created Jack High Bowls to provide a useful resource for bowls related product reviews and buying guides.

Choosing the right equipment you need to play is a daunting experience, especially for new bowlers. No one wants to feel conned, or like they are making a huge mistake and wasting your money. This is what we aim to help with. Helpful, fluff-free reviews that explains the key pain-points and features in a simple to understand and friendly manner.

With years of experience under our belts we can help you select the right equipment, and who knows, maybe improve your game along the way!
