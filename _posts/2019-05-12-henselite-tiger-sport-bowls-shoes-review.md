## Comfort
The Henselite Tiger sport has many features to improve comfort. Firstly, it's superior construction along with their choice of quality materials ensures long term durability. This leads to long term comfort fit.

An example of this is the latex orthopaedic mid-sole for comfort and support.

They have also added an anti-bacterial inner-sole with moisture wicking to help remove sweat. This is ideal when playing in the peak summer months.

Tiger Sport have some great overall feedback. Many commenting on superior comfort and support.

One report of cracking in the toe area, however this looks to be an isolated case. 12 month warranty so any issues can be solved.

Despite this, many customers are impressed by the superb build quality.

## Overall Verdict

The Tiger Sports are in the higher price bracket, however the extra benefits you get from the high-tech approach from Henselite means they are more than worth the money.
