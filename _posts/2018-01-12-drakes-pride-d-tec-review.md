Overview: The d-tec is one of the best narrow line bowls available. Ideal for either indoor, or outdoor lead bowling, the d-tec offers a consistent flat finishing draw shot. Although it doesn’t come with the latest PRO50 grip option, it does have all of the standard options in place.

Price: £289.99 (£125.00 used)

There are many offerings for bowlers looking to upgrade their bowls, and the latest offering from one of the most recognised and trusted brands in bowls could help take your game to the next level.

Today I will be looking at the d-tec range from Drakes Pride. The d-tec was launched to replace the two previous narrow biased bowls (the Fineline and the Advantage) producing a single, multi-purpose use bowl.

## Line analysis

Drakes Pride introduced the d-tec to replace their existing Fineline and Advantage models, in doing so the gave the d-tec a bias somewhere in between the two previous ones. It is therefore the narrowest of all current drakes pride ranges, cutting inside the line of the popular Professional range.

Unlike the Professional range however, it has less as less of a “hook” on the line, providing a much smoother, flatter finish. The added benefit of the cleaner flatter finish as this really helps with “punching” shots as only an extra yard is required, as opposed to 2 or 3 required with the Professional.

## Sizes and Weights

As you’d expect the d-tec comes in sizes 00 to 5, however is only available in “Heavyweight”. If you’re looking for anything else, you will have to try elsewhere!

## Grips and colours

The d-tec comes with two grip options, the 30 dimple grip, and ring grip. Both are common amongst Drakes Pride bowls so either are perfectly good and will come down to personal preference. Unfortunately there is no option for the latest PRO50 deep groove dimple grips, which is a huge shame.

You can pick these bowls up in one of a number of different colours, our personal favourite are the “White Yellow Green” design shown below.


## Overall Verdict
Although it is marketed as “the ideal indoor bowl” it could quite easily be used outdoor if you require a slightly tighter line, if you are playing lead for example. I can highly recommend the d-tec bowl, with the only blemish being the lack of PR50 grip options.
