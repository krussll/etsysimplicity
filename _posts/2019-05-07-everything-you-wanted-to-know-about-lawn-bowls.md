## What are bowls made of?

Lawn bowls were originally made of wood, but are now made with composite plastic. 

This not only makes the bowls last longer, but also allows for manufacturers to make the bowls to the same specification each and every time.

## Why do lawn bowls curve?

Lawn bowls are not perfectly round - at least not to the naked eye. One side will be slightly bigger than the other, this is known as the “bias”. 

It's the extra weight on one side of the bowl that generates the curve.

Different models will have different biases, the bigger the bias the more the bowl will curve. This allows a bowler to select a bowl that generates the curve they need.

## Do bowls expire?

No, bowls do not have an expiry date. As long as there is no visible damage they should be fine to use regardless of age.

Bowls do need to be “stamped” every couple of years if you want to compete at a high level. The stamp shows the bowls have been tested to a high standard and can be used in competitive games.

## What is the best brand of lawn bowls?

The 4 major brands of lawn bowls are Aero, Drakes Pride, Thomas Taylor, and Henselite. These 4 brands produce nearly all of the lawn bowls sold Worldwide. The best one will come down to personal preference.
