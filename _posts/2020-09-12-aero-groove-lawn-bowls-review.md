<div class="overview" markdown="1">

We spent  8.5 hours reading reviews from experts and users. In summary, this is what other bowlers think:

3 reasons to buy:
* Great allrounder. Can be played indoors and outdoors
* Possible competitor for the Taylor Ace
* Innovative colour and grip choices




1 reason to not buy:
* Very small second hand market for Aero models, so you will have to buy new

## Bottom line

Aero are relatively new to the UK market, but have been a big player in Australia for a number of years. The Groove is the most popular model in the range, and there is good reason for this.

It’s line profile makes it a fantastic all round bowl, ideal for playing indoor and outdoor without sacrificing performance to favour either.

Line outdoors offers enough bias to play most positions without it becoming unmanageable to control indoors. Aero also offers great colour and grip choices which are unique to them.

Price: £356


## Line analysis

For comparison for those in the UK, the Groove has a line profile similar to the Taylor Ace.

It’s suitable for middle and back end playing positions on average indoor surfaces, and can easily be played from most outdoor positions - however it may be a tad narrow for skips who like to draw around short bowls, so would lean towards lead/front-end roles.

Aero has designed their models to follow a unique arc trajectory. This “mid point” trajectory bends at the centre point between the mat and jack and is designed to give the most consistent draw arc possible.

The Groove also holds it’s line with minimum weight, which is ideal for yard-on weighted shots as little line compensation should be required to hit the target bowl.

## Sizes and Weights

Aero Grooves are available in sizes00 through 5, including half sizes - which is very rare and is something we’ve only seen done “as standard” by Aero. 

Only available in heavyweight.

## Grips and colours

Aero offers the widest range of colour options. We are big fans of the gradient and stripped effects. They also offer unique emblem options, with the choice of a standard sized emblem, or in “large”. This large option makes the emblem take up the entirety of the area within the gripped shoulder - and is a very unique look. It's a bit of a grower and one we have grown fond of!


Three unique grips only available with Aero:
* The Z Scoop (as standard)
* Zig Zag
* Dentations

### Z Scoop Grip


The revolutionary Z Scoop® grip will make the bowl feel smaller in the hand as the grip sits in the bowl rather than around the bowl. This unique feature means that bowlers can now go up half a size, and ONLY Aero make a full range of half sizes. Going up a full size is a big step and is not something we suggest without contacting us for advice.
The cleverly designed Z Scoop® grip enables bowlers to hold their bowl in the same way every time helping to ensure a smooth release on each delivery.
It is particularly effective in wet conditions and it gives extra confidence and control when holding the bowl.


### Zig-Zag Grip


The registered design and perfectly placed ZIG ZAG grips give excellent reference for effective handling of the bowl without being too prominent on a bowlers fingers. The grip is designed wide, to suit those who place fingers on the top or sides of the bowl. In wet weather this cleverly designed grip assists in holding the bowl and the grip is chip proof. 

### Dentations Grip



This registered design was developed for wind control. Besides the stunning appearance, the first thing you notice is the feel…there’s nothing quite like it in the hand. The subtle but sure grip gives you maximum confidence. On the green, it is designed to deflect wind away from the bowl, thanks to the turbulent flow effect caused by the precision Aero Dentations.

Wind hits the Dentations and is directed away from the bowl. Much like the Zig Zag does in the Z Scoop® designed grip.
