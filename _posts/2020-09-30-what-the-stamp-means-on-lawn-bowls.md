## What does the stamp mean on lawn bowls?

**The stamp on lawn bowls is used to show when the bowl was last tested to ensure it meets international standards. Bowls must go through this process every 10 years, much like a car requires an MOT. The stamp shows who tested it, to which standard it was tested too, and the year it requires re-testing.**

Depending on the age of your bowl you may see a stamp that looks like one of these:

They will look different depending on when the bowl was manufactured, or when it was last tested.

The latest style, and the most common, is the first. This was brought in in 2013 to co-inside with the latest regulations from World Bowls.

Regardless of the look, the components are the same.

## The Expiry Year

We suggest competitive bowlers get their bowls checked regularly as wear on the running surface of the bowl will straighten the run of the bowl.

## The Trademark

The “R” shows that the stamp is a registered trademark.

## The Standard

Prior to the 2002 introduction of the World Bowls stamp, bowls were stamped with the stamps of the International Bowling Board and prior to 1988 bowls had the stamp of the major countries.

## The Manufacturer/Tester

Companies need to be licenced by World Bowls in order to officially stamp bowls. Each one is given a unique letter code which is included on the stamp. This way, if there is a fault from the test it can be traced back.

Companies can either be stand-alone testers who specialise in re-stamping bowls, or they can be the original manufacturer of the bowl - as the original stamp will be done by the source manufacturer.

Below is a list of all bowl testing companies, along with their stamp codes.
