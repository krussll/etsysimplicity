## Ranking points explained

The rankings are complied at the end of each season. Points are awarded based on performance in Wold, Scottish, International and Qualifier tournaments.

The top 16 get automatic entry into all World Bowls and Tour ranking events for the next season. The top 8 are also given automatic qualification in the World Mixed Pairs, and can also choose their partner from the top 16 for entry in the World Open Pairs.
