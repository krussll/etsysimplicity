Taylor have a long history of creating quality bowls, therefore we have high hopes for their principal narrow line bowl, the Vector VS. The Vector VS is currently the best selling indoor bowl and are hugely popular in Australia. Let's see what all the fuss is about...

## Line Analysis

The Vector VS is Taylor's main narrow line bowl, so as we'd expect it has a consistent, gentle draw. It also as a smooth “hook free” finish, designed to aide a lead or front-end bowler.

Because of the bias characteristics this model is also suited to your indoor bowling, or when you play fast outdoor greens. Play on anything slow or heavy could affect your game due to the narrow line not being able to navigate around other bowls in the head.


## Sizes and Weights

Taylor offers all their models in the full range of sizes  (00 to 5) as well as a good selection of weights, including medium, heavy and extra heavy.

## Grips and colours

The grip choices are a pretty standard. Dimple and plain grips are available, and will be down to your preference.

You also have the choice of 11 striking colour choices. Solid and speckle colours are available and come in a range from traditional, to spectacular!

The Vector VS comes in at a slightly higher price point, so could be considered a more “premium” choice, however there is a strong second hand market for them, so you maybe able to get the benefits for a more reasonable price.

If you are a lead bowler who plays predominantly indoors, you'd be hard pushed to find a better bowl. With its clean narrow line you can make some real improvements in your draw.
