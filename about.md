Hi, my name is Reece.

I’ve been a seller on Etsy for 8 years. In that time I have made sales worth nearly £50k - most of which was in the last 3 years.

I believe Etsy stores are a great way to earn some side income - I opened my Etsy store to help save for a deposit on a house. In 2018 I hit my target and my wife and I bought our first home together.

Etsy is great for adding that bit extra in your pocket each month. Whilst many stores do make enough for a full-time income, it has never been a target of mine.

I created this site to help others boost their income through a manageable, and sustainable Etsy store.

At the end of 2020, I opened my second Etsy store. I hope to use this store as an example of how it is still possible to open and build an Etsy store today!

If you are interested in what I’m doing over on Etsy you can find my two stores here:


## Williams Prints

Opened in 2013, Williams Prints is my main store. I have built this store up over that time to earn a nice side income. In 2020 I sold over £16k worth of prints. By far my best year to date!


## Travel Man Prints

Opened in 2020. I use this store as a case study here on Etsy Simplicity to show how you can build your own store!

I hope this site can help give you the confidence to open your own store and give you the guidance to build it.
